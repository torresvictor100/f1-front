# F1 Graphics
This project was developed by an enthusiast passionate about Formula 1 and programming. Its main purpose is to serve as a repository of processed F1 data graphics, providing customization options so that anyone can incorporate these graphics and data into their presentations about this fascinating sport.

We accept collaborations; our project started on 10/23. It's still very recent, but we will manage to make progress with this project more and more.
